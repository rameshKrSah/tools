### Managing Machine Learning Projects
- [Keepsake](https://github.com/replicate/keepsake) 
   - Automatically track code, hyperparameters, training data (in a sense), weights, metrics, Python dependencies.
   - Go back the code and weights from any checkpoint if need to replicate your results or commit to Git after the fact.
   - Version control your machine learning models.

- [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc)
   - Management and versioning of datasets and machine learning models. 
   - Makes project reproducible and shareable
   - Manage experiments with Git tags/branches and metrics tracking
