# Tools

A repo to list and explain software tools and framework for different purposes.

## Managing machine learning projects
- [Keepsake](https://github.com/replicate/keepsake) 
   - Automatically track code, hyperparameters, training data (in a sense), weights, metrics, Python dependencies.
   - Go back the code and weights from any checkpoint if need to replicate your results or commit to Git after the fact.
   - Version control your machine learning models.

- [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc)
   - Management and versioning of datasets and machine learning models. 
   - Makes project reproducible and shareable
   - Manage experiments with Git tags/branches and metrics tracking

- [MLFlow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow)
   - Platform for machine learning development with experiment tracking, packing code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.

- [ClearML](https://clear.ml/)
   - Experiment management tool to track parameters, jobs, artifacts, metrics, debug data, metadata, and log everything (MLFlow)
   - Manage resources and scaling on cloud (Kubeflow)
   - Data analysis versioning and lineage for full reproducibility (DVC)

- [Optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
   - Automatic hyperparameter optimization framework
   - Imperative, define-by-run style

- [HyperOpt](https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/)
   - Distributed Asynchronous Hyperparameter Optimization

- [Sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred)
   - A tool to configure, organize, log, and reproduce experiments.

- [PyPaDS](https://pypads.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   - Automate logging by tracking the libraries
 
- [Comet ML](https://www.comet.ml/site/)
   - Track, compare, explain, and optimize experiments and models

- [Neptune ai](https://neptune.ai/)
   - Log, store, display, organize, compare, and query all MLOps metadata.

- [Aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim)
   - Super-easy way to record, search and compare 1000s of ML training runs

- [Guild ai](https://guild.ai/)
   - Track experiments, automate pipelines, tune hyperparameters

- [Weight & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)
   - Experiment tracking, model and dataset versioning, hyperparameter optimization
